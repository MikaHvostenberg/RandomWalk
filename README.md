Hello there, this is the repository of the simulations scripts that were made for the physics Bachelor project of the Group 13 by Markuss and Stanislavs. 
If you have an access to this repository, you are free to copy, launch and use these scripts for the sake of your reaserch and/or other commercial purposes.
Entropy is a public commodity and anyone can experience it! Good luck and have fun!
